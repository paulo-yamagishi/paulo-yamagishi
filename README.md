# Paulo Yamagishi

**MSc researcher at COPPE/UFRJ | Combinatorial optimization | AI-augmented development**

## About Me

I'm a Master's student in Systems and Computer Engineering at COPPE/UFRJ (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), researching combinatorial optimization and integer programming. I hold a BS in Computer Science from UFRJ (GPA 8.4/10) and an MBA in Macroeconomics & Portfolio Management.

## Research

First-author paper at ERMAC 2026 (Florianopolis) on variable fixing for the Set Cover Problem, in collaboration with Prof. Jon Lee (University of Michigan). My work involves developing dual trajectory methods in C/GLPK for large-scale optimization problems.

## AI-Augmented Development

Claude Code is my primary development tool — I rely on it daily for agentic workflows, prompt engineering, and AI-assisted software development.
